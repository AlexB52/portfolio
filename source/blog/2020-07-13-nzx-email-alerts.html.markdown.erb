# Free NZX Email Alerts

In this article, I'll detail how to get price alerts emailed to you for any NZX company stock prices. All you need is a Gmail and Zapier account! You can create a zapier account [here](https://zapier.com/)

## #1 - The Google Spreadsheet

Create a Google spreadsheet as shown on the screenshot. You can download a [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m1yOnZ0Hk26PsN-LD4xiHbLo9bCmHLoaInlYLmHytOc/edit?usp=sharing) to help you out.

### The columns

Fill each column as described in the table for each company you want to set a price alert.

|Cell|Column|Description|Example|Comment|
|-
|A2|Company|The name of the company you follow|Air New Zealand||
|B2|Ticker|The Google Finance Symbol of the company|NZE:AIR||
|C2|Target|The target price you want to set your alert to|$1.2|The number is formatted as a currency|
|D2|Current Price|The current price of the said stock|=GOOGLEFINANCE(B2)|B2 is NZE:AIR|
|E2|Alert Triggered?|Column showing if your price is met|=C2>=D2|Current Price is less or equal to Target Price|

### Enable Automatic Updates

In the spreadsheet settings, you need to set the calculations to `on change and every minute` so that your spreadsheet keeps being updated after you close it.

## #2 - Create a Zap with Zapier

Once your spreadsheet finalised, it is time to make the magic happen with Zapier.

Head to [Zapier website](https://zapier.com/) and create a new Zap.

### Step #1: The Trigger

This step configures the event that will trigger the ZAP and maybe send an email. In our case the event that will trigger a potential email is the when a stock Current Price is updated. Follow the steps below to configure properly Zapier.

#### 1. Choose App & Event

* **Choose App**: Google Sheets
* **Choose Trigger Event**: New or Updated Spreadsheet Row

#### 2. Choose Account

* **Google Sheets**: Enable OR Choose your Gmail account

#### 3. Customize Spreadsheet Row

* **Spreadsheet**: <Name of your spreadsheet>. Ex: Price Alerts Template
* **Worksheet**: <Name of the Tab>. Ex: Alerts
* **Trigger** Column: <Name of the column to watch>. Ex: Current Price

#### 4. Find Data

Test that your spreadsheet is identifying correctly which column to look for updates

<div data-controller="collapse" data-collapse-display="block">
  <%= link_to 'Toggle image', '#', data: { action: 'collapse#toggleImage' } %>
  {:refdef: data-target="collapse.image"}
  ![trigger](2020-07-13-nzx-email-alerts/1-the-trigger-opt.gif)
  {: refdef}
</div>

**Proceed to the next step**

### Step #2: The Filter

This step will help Zapier identify whether an email should be sent or not. If your `Alert Triggered?` column shows `TRUE`, this is when Zapier should send an email.

#### 1. Choose App & Event

* **Choose App**: Filter by Zapier

#### 2. Filter Setup & Testing

To do so, choose only continue if the Trigger Column `Alert Triggered?` is `(Boolean) is True`.

<div data-controller="collapse" data-collapse-display="none">
  <%= link_to 'Toggle image', '#', data: { action: 'collapse#toggleImage' } %>
  {:refdef: data-target="collapse.image"}
  ![trigger](2020-07-13-nzx-email-alerts/2-the-filter-opt.gif)
  {: refdef}
</div>

**Proceed to the next step**

### Step #3: The Action
This step configures the email to send when the alert is triggered.

#### 1. Choose App & Event

* **Choose App**: Gmail
* **Choose Action Event**: Send Email

#### 2. Choose Account

* Enable OR Choose your Gmail account

#### 3. Customize Email

Fill the required field to complete that step. You can choose what you want but here are some good defaults.

* **To**: [your email address]
* **From**: [your email address]
* **Subject**: [Google Sheets: Company] stock price has reached: [Google Sheets: Current Price]
* **Body**: You receive this email from a Zap you created because a NZX company has reached your target price.

#### 4. Send Data

Test that you receive an email and that everything is configured correctly

<div data-controller="collapse" data-collapse-display="none">
  <%= link_to 'Toggle image', '#', data: { action: 'collapse#toggleImage' } %>
  {:refdef: data-target="collapse.image"}
  ![trigger](2020-07-13-nzx-email-alerts/3-the-action-opt.gif)
  {: refdef}
</div>

### Step #4: ENABLE YOUR ZAP!

Done! you'll now receive an email every time, one of a stock price on your spreadhseet meets your target price.

If you want to stop receiving an email after the first alert is sent just remove the row on your table.
